about time i started on my personal site

i keep telling myself that i'll build it when i have x project to show off or i've achieved y task at work or when i'm a halfway competent programmer, but if i keep saying that it will probably never happen, so...let's build a crappy site and iterate on it

---

will build this primarily in react with a node backend because why not - i've never used a static site generator and figure there may be a need for one at some point. it will primarily be a design project

would eventually like to build in a "blog" of sorts too. not that anyone will ever actually read it, but at the very least it can serve as a record of the things i've been working on and thinking about, to myself if no one else. but first i'll focus on deploying the simplest possible thing
